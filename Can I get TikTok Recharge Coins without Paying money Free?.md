<p class="" data-start="186" data-end="486"><strong data-start="186" data-end="245">Creators can earn coins through the TikTok Creator Fund</strong>.

<h3 class="" data-start="1525" data-end="1541">Be Cautious:</h3>
<p class="" data-start="1542" data-end="1769">Avoid third-party websites or apps that promise <strong data-start="1590" data-end="1604">free coins</strong>&mdash;they can be <strong data-start="1617" data-end="1626">scams</strong> and may compromise your account security or even get your account banned. Always use official TikTok channels for any promotions or purchases.</p>
